# So_Long 👾
Mini Game in 2D 

## Description 🔍
My first graphics project which consists of implementing a 2D game using minilibX (42 graphics library). The player's goal is to collect all the items on the map, then escape using the exit. Coded in C, I appreciated finding a good way to stock all the variable in many struct and use it for the implementation.
I really enjoyed implementing and coding the logic of the game + displaying my first pixels and texture was a real pleasure! 🤩
